## File Structure

```
ay-website/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css          # All CSS styles
├── script.js           # JavaScript functionality
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Form Functionality

The waitlist form currently stores submissions in the browser's localStorage for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would want to:

1. **Set up a backend server** (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
2. **Configure a database** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
3. **Add email notifications** for new submissions
4. **Implement proper data validation** and security measures

## Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages (Recommended for now)
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Select source branch (usually `main`)
4. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

### Other Options
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop deployment
- **Vercel**: Git-based deployment
- **Traditional hosting**: Upload files to any web server

## Customization

### Colors
The color scheme uses a purple gradient theme. To change colors, modify the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
/* Primary gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Images
Replace the Unsplash placeholder URLs with your own images:
- Hero image: Line 35 in `index.html`
- About section image: Line 52 in `index.html`
- Teachers section image: Line 108 in `index.html`

### Content
